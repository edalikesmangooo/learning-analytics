# Uncovering Learning Patterns in Collaborative Museum Games

This site documents a **multi-phase research study** investigating individual learning patterns within collaborative, multiplayer game environments in museum settings. Using **computational behavioral analysis** (t-SNE spatial embedding, critical change points detection), **statistical validation methods** (mixed ANOVA, trajectory progression analysis), and **integration of the statistical analysis with machine learning techniques**, this work reveals the relationship between strategic convergence and learning progression during collaborative gameplay.

## Research Focus

Understanding and supporting collaborative learning through multi-method analytics in authentic educational environments.

### Core Questions
1. When and how do **critical behavioral shifts** occur during individual learning within collaborative gameplay sessions?
2. What computational methods can **reliably** **detect and characterize** these learning transitions?
3. What **distinct individual behavioral patterns** emerge during collaborative learning sessions?
4. How can integrated spatial-temporal analytics inform **evidence-based design** for collaborative learning environments?
