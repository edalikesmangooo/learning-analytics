    "content": "Rainbow Agents is a two-player collaborative game designed to support learning of core computer science concepts such as loops, conditionals, and randomness. As an interactive exhibit, it was deployed at two U.S. science museums to explore informal, socially embedded learning through gameplay. While museums are studied as unique learning environments, little research has examined how collaborative digital games, particularly those focused on computer science, operate in such settings. This study addresses that gap through large-scale behavioral analysis. Our investigation was motivated by two fundamental questions: . Individual &amp; Collaborative Learning Dynamics: When and how do critical behavioral shifts occur during both individual learning and collaborative interaction within gameplay? . Computational Detection Methods: What analytical approaches can reliably detect and characterize distinct behavioral patterns that emerge during these sessions? . The deployment yielded over 1.5 million interaction logs from 1,300+ sessions involving more than 3,000 players. Note: Exploratory analyses used strategic subsampling to manage computational load; specific sample sizes are detailed in each phase. ",
